            <p>
                Hi there if your reading this then you probably have met me or seen something of mine. Im Tiernan and Im a Mechatronics Grad from the university of auckland. 
                Before getting into bit more about me, I should say why this page in teh first place exists. Firstly I wanted to have a place where I can keep track of the projects I have worked on so that 
                I have a record I can look back on and be proud of. Secondly this page is a way for me to more show off my work in better way than a small two sentence description on
                my CV. I hope you enjoy have a read through some of the projects I have done both ones at Uni and onces I have done in my own time. If you want to get in touch with me there is a contact page. Any other cool
                project ideas would also be greatly appreciated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some background about me, I have always been much more on the side of engineering and technology. I was massively into Lego and Thomas the Tank Engine (Still have a limited edition set of the old diecast ones). At Highschool I 
                did all the sciences and maths with a bit of classics mixed in to spice it up. When it came to going to university from the first talk I went to I was sold on Engineering. The question that was more important to me was which specialisation.
                I was originally going to do biomedical engineering but after a further thinking I wanted to do something that allowed me to work on a wide range of project and not be restricted to just one area. Mechatronics therefore was the logical choice.
                In doing mechatronics it fostered my love for all areas of engineering and technology. Working on multidisciplinary projects that required a range of skills and knowledge. Having the knowledge to be able to go from software design(Such as making this website) to 
                hardware/electrical  and mechanical design I think is a great skill to have and essentially allows me to make anything that interests me to varying degrees of success.

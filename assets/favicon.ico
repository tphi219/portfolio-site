The file /portfolio-site/portfolio-site/assets/favicon.ico is intended to be a favicon file, which is typically a binary file rather than text. Since I cannot generate binary content directly, you will need to create or obtain a favicon image file and save it as favicon.ico in the specified directory. 

This file is intentionally left blank.
